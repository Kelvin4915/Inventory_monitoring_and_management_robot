# Inventory Monitoring and Management Robot Project

The Project involves the design and implementation of an autonomous inventory monitoring and management robot for a warehouse by identifying and counting defective and non-defective widgets. The robot will navigate using directional aids and count the widgets based on corresponding markers (ArUco tags) and display the count at the end of its course. The mock warehouse will have three sections, each with an object housing directional aids and a widget station. The robot needs to autonomously navigate based on the directional aids, detect the widget stations, and count the inventory at each station based on the tag ID. At the end of its course, the robot must reach its final destination without a path to follow and show the inventory count.
